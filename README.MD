## About

### Description
We all have many interests that have changed over time. Specifically Interests in media content. For me, it specifically has to do with books, anime or movies I watched a couple of times in the past and can't remember right now. I wish I could remember it, better still, I wished I had tracked it so that in the future, I would be able to come back to it.

That is what *Interest* does. 
Interests helps you track all your interest chronologically, in an easy use interface. 
You never have to rack your brains to remember that old high school movie you watched with your friends, or that random show you saw at Grandma's house. Once you have tracked it with interests, it can be retrieved.

Interest is available for *web*, and *mobile*.
